# LabCal — shared probe offsets vault (v1.2.1)

Load each offsets file **once, on the home page**. Every worksheet then picks it
up automatically until the reference thermometer's certificate expires.

## v1.2.1 — frozen tiles fix (iPad)

v1.2 had a bug that froze the tiles whenever **two or more tabs of the site were
open at once**. The vault checked whether storage was usable by writing a
throwaway key on *every read* — and that key sat inside the range of keys the
other tabs were watching. So each tab's read woke the other tab, which read,
which woke the first one back, hundreds of times a second. Tiles were rebuilt
mid-tap (hence frozen and jittering) and taps landed on elements that no longer
existed. Closing every tab cleared it because the loop needs two tabs to bounce
between.

Fixed three ways: the storage check now runs once per page and writes outside
the watched key range; change listeners ignore anything that isn't one of the
two ecosystem keys and skip redundant redraws; and tiles are only rewritten when
the markup has actually changed, so a redraw can never swallow a tap.

Also: an open worksheet no longer rebuilds its dropdowns unless the offsets file
genuinely changed, so a probe you have already selected mid-job stays selected.

## Upload these files

Everything in this folder goes to the same directory on your site. The files
that actually changed:

| File | What changed |
|---|---|
| `labcal_offsets.js` | **NEW** — the shared vault. Must sit next to the HTML files. |
| `index.html` | Offsets panel with countdown + warnings; Calibration section locks until a file is loaded |
| `calibration.html` | Each worksheet card locks unless *its own* ecosystem's file is loaded |
| `monitoring_systems.html` | Same gating for Cloud Temp |
| `barkey_calibration_form.html` | Auto-loads Dostmann offsets from the vault |
| `calibration_worksheet_SMD.html` | Auto-loads Dostmann offsets |
| `calibration_worksheet_SNMD.html` | Auto-loads Fluke & Comark offsets |
| `calibration_worksheet_19_24.html` | Auto-loads Fluke & Comark offsets |
| `cloud_temp.html` | Auto-loads Fluke & Comark offsets |
| `sw.js` | Cache bumped to **v6**, caches `labcal_offsets.js` |
| `tools.html`, `data_logger_viewer.html`, `pdf_merge_reorder.html` | Unchanged — included so the folder is complete |

After uploading, open the home page once while online so the service worker
picks up v6, then hit **Refresh offline copy**.

## Which file unlocks what

| Ecosystem | Unlocks |
|---|---|
| **Dostmann** | Barkey · Standard Medical Device |
| **Fluke & Comark** | Standard Non-Medical · 19/24 Range · Monitoring Systems (Cloud Temp) |

The two are never interchangeable — loading a Fluke file into the Dostmann slot
is refused with a clear message, and vice versa.

## Countdown and warnings

The vault counts down to the **last day of the "valid until" month**.

- more than 60 days left → green "Valid to Mon/YYYY"
- 60 days or less → amber "N days left" on the home page
- 14 days or less → red pulsing warning on the home page **and** an amber strip
  at the top of every worksheet
- expired → everything using that file locks; no PDF or Excel can be generated

## Notes

- Storage is the browser's `localStorage` for this site, so it is per-device and
  per-browser. iPad Safari clears it after about 7 days with no visits to the
  site — if that happens, just load the files again on the home page.
- The "Load offsets" button on each worksheet still works and now **writes back
  to the vault**, so loading a file on any worksheet updates all the others.
- If `labcal_offsets.js` is ever missing, nothing locks up: the pages fall back
  to the old per-worksheet behaviour.
